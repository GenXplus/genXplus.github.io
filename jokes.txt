A baby boomer, a gen xer, and a millennial are asked to put a square peg in a round hole.

A baby boomer whittles down the peg until it's round.

A gen Xer makes a new hole.

A millennial demands that there should only be square holes for their square pegs. 
Any round holes should be eliminated, and are considered racist, sexist, or homophobic.

Are Millennials allergic to fresh air?
